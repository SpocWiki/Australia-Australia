## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Cape York Peninsula is a peninsula located in Far North Queensland, Australia. 
> It is the largest wilderness in northern Australia. 
> The land is mostly flat and about half of the area is used for grazing cattle. 
> The relatively undisturbed eucalyptus-wooded savannahs, tropical rainforests 
> and other habitats are now recognised and preserved for their global environmental significance. 
> 
> Although much of the peninsula remains pristine, 
> with a diverse repertoire of endemic flora and fauna, 
> some of its wildlife may be threatened by industry and overgrazing 
> as well as by introduced species and weeds.
>
> The northernmost point of the peninsula is Cape York.
>
> The land has been occupied 
> by a number of Aboriginal Australian peoples for tens of thousands of years. 
> In 1606, Dutch sailor Willem Janszoon on board the Duyfken 
> was the first European to land in Australia, reaching the Cape York Peninsula.
