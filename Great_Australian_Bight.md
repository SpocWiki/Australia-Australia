> The Great Australian Bight is a large oceanic bight, or open bay, 
> off the central and western portions of the southern coastline of mainland Australia.
>
> There are two definitions for its extentâ€”
> - one by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) 
> - and another by the Australian Hydrographic Service (AHS). 
> The bight is generally considered part of the Indian Ocean, 
> although the AHS classifies it as part of the Southern Ocean. 
> Its coastline is characterized by cliff faces and rocky capes, 
> making it an ideal location for whale-watching.
>
> This oceanic feature was first encountered by European explorers in 1627, 
> and was accurately charted by English navigator Matthew Flinders in 1802. 
> The Great Australian Bight came into existence about 50 million years ago 
> when the supercontinent Gondwana broke apart, separating Antarctica from Australia.
>
> The Bight's waters are highly biodiverse, especially in zooplankton, due to specific ocean currents. 
> However, more research is needed to fully understand the region's complex ecosystems 
> and the potential impacts of human activities, such as resource extraction. 
> 
> Southern bluefin tuna are a popular fishing target in the Bight, 
> and there have been attempts to explore the area for oil and gas since the 1960s. 
> However, these proposals have faced significant opposition due to the potential environmental impacts.
